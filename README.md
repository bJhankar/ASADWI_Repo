# _**ASADWI**: AI-based Spatial Analysis for Drinking Water Information_ #

## **Project Name Origin:** ##
_**ASADWI**_ is derived from the Hindi word "आसाढ़," representing a rain-dominant month. This project, ASADWI (AI-based Spatial Analysis for Drinking Water Information), is developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2023. The application focuses on providing spatial analyses related to water quality, geology, and lithology based on user-provided location information.
    Orignal Name : AquaSense - AI Driven Well Insights

## **Machine Learning Models:** ##
    Three machine learning models predict water quality, geology information, and lithology based on user-provided location data. While these models are functional, they are acknowledged as inefficient due to limited datasets, resulting in suboptimal time complexity.

## **Call for Contributions:** ##
* Improved Machine Learning Models:
    * Contributors are invited to enhance the existing models through:
        * Advanced algorithms.
        * Inclusion of larger and more relevant datasets.
        * Improved feature engineering.
        * Optimized hyperparameters.
        
* UI/UX Enhancements:
    * Contributions towards improving the user interface and experience are highly appreciated. This includes design enhancements, usability improvements, and creative additions.

## **Note to Contributors:** ##
    This project welcomes contributions to address model inefficiencies and improve user experience. Please feel free to fork the repository, make pull requests, and collaborate to make ASADWI a more robust and user-friendly platform. We appreciate efforts towards refining machine learning models, leveraging extensive datasets, and enhancing UI/UX for impactful spatial analysis. Let's create something valuable together!
